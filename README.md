# Ribbit

A small and portable Scheme implementation that supports closures, tail calls, first-class continuations, a REPL and AOT and incremental compilers. All that for a run time footprint around 4 KB!

You can [try the REPL with a minimal library here](https://udem-dlteam.github.io/ribbit/repl-min.html) or [try a more featureful version here](https://udem-dlteam.github.io/ribbit/repl-max.html).
